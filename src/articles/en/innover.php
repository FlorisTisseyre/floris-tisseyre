			<div class="ui small header">« What can you tell us about innovation? »</div>
			<p>As soon as innovation is mentioned, we think of these companies that invented a new technology or built a revolutionary product.</p>
			<p>I believe however that innovation is wider, in everything that radically change our way of proceeding, let it be our way to organize, to manage, to code, …</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« Meaning? Can you elaborate with one of your experiences? »</div>
			<p>Yes of course, I believe that the "Kick-off" days when I was Change Leader at Arcelor Mittal would illustrate.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« And you specifically, what have you achieve? »</div>
			<p>A few months after my arrival in the service, I have been asked to organize the launch of the new company master plan: Med2020. With less than two months to accomplish that, I was expected to do as in the previous occasions: a speech with pomp and circumstance for each area of the plant, meaning 6 conferences of about 500 attendees.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« That sounds reasonable given the deadline »</div>
			<p>Indeed, but I would have obtained the same feedback as previously: « again a new plan that will change nothing in the end».</p>
			<p>I took the gamble to let every one of the 3000 employees understand what WCM has to offer to them. For your knowledge, it's an approach covering Toyota TPM, Lean, Six Sigma and Goldratt Theory Of Constraints.</p>
			<p>Workers, as most of people anyway, fully understand only if they do with their hands. And to run workshops, groups should be smaller than 15 people.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« Wow! But that's hundreds of sessions? »</div>
			<p>Yes, approximately 240 and this was not the hardest part!</p>
			<p>For what I wanted to achieve, a specific place was required, not the auditorium that we ordinary used. It meant transforming a 500 m² warehouse to create projections area and workshops area where groups could experiment WCM.</p>
			<p>But first and foremost, to help them understand how WCM could benefit them, we had to give meaning to this method, find out where the added value stood and design workshops that highlighted benefits.</p>
			<p>And lastly, we have trained 30 people that became WCM leaders and that facilitated the 240 workshops.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« You consider that experience as innovation, aren't you? »</div>
			<p>Exactly! We have drastically changed the way to kick off a master plan and that provided spectacular results:</p>
			<ul class="noBulletList">
				<li>The vast majority of employees was satisfied and ready to actively participate to this transformation and, even rarer, all the unions has « applauded » the approach.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>And then I carried on this innovation approach at Anaqua Services.</p>
