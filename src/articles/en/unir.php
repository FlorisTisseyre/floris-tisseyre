			<p>I would say that unite people consist of hilighting their similarities.</p>
			
            <div class="ui small header">« And if there's none? »</div>
			<p>Here is my <b>first day at Anaqua Services</b> where I meet that problem:</p>
			<p>I arrived in an office where I met Benoît, the sysadmin, hired following a professional retraining and Julien, the dev, working for Anaqua for 5 years and great guru of the internal business software. Well, the whole team is there? And yes, there's Stéphane, but in fact he is not coming every day and furthermore, he works esentially on the web site. Today he is at home. Plus in fact, the previous manager that I'm replacing, Benjamin, still works here but only on Thursday and Fiday. And finally, there is Alexandre but no one knows if he is really part of the team and anyway, he is coming only a week every three ; the remaining time he is working from home, in Nice.</p>
			<p>Wow! It appears that these details had been omitted during my recrutment interview.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« So I was right, non commonality … so no team? »</div>
			<p>It took a while but I finally manage to find something fundamental that was common to every member of the team.</p>
			<p>From the very nature of our job, we need to take decisions all the time: concerning the strategy for evolving the software, on the way to solve a problem, to choose the best solution but also and foremost daily, all day long, on the way we behave, we code, we answer to our colleagues, our clients, …</p>
			<p>All these choices are guided by our values and I asked that we share them.</p>
			<p>In the form of workshops, we have carefully crafted each team value that needed to be approved and adopted by each member of the team and we finally posted them on a wall.</p>
			<p>These are the same values that helped me choose the keywords on this very resume.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« And that's all ??? Hop, a team just like that? »</div>
			<p>No, and pretty far from that, it required nearly 2 years for the true team to emerged, where everyone backup the other, pull together, challenge themselves and foremost where we get together when things go wrong.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« Yes so the values, it's just for communication »</div>
			<p>No, quite the contrary, values helped us as guide trough ordeals that we met. For each choice, each turnabout, we relied on them to decide the best way to go.</p>
			<p>To keep them shared by everyone, these values were presented to newcomers, being for the three recruits or the interns.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« OK, and what else then? »</div>
			<p>Two other questions that I'm wandering constantly are: « Where do we go? » and « What is the point of what we are doing? ».</p>
			<p>At Arcelor Mittal, we had to make sustainable production by recasting the whole steel mill computing system: it provided meaning for this monstrous project, even if it's hard to find value on a daily basis on that kind of long running project.</p>
			<p>Alongside Change Leaders, I had to launch the new company master plan. I did a huge wager (see « Innovate » subject): increase understanding of 3000 employees on how WCM could improve their daily work. Nights were short but it was worth the pain: the 30 WCM leaders united to overcome problems and conclude the launch. Second effect: a vast part of employees identified themselves in values brought by this shift of approach.</p>
			<p>Finally, after few months in Anaqua Services, we have started to talk about a recast but the goal was too far to really unite us. The real transformation came with Agility where team engage every tow weeks on a goal to achieve. It's concrete stuff, it's short term, it's team play … and it changes everything.</p>
			
			<div class="ui small header">« So no miracle receipt? »</div>
			<p>I don't believe, even if values are universal.</p>
